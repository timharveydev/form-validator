A simple Javascript form validator created for practising Javascript. I've done my best to adhere to ES6 standards and to keep the code clean and streamlined.

The validation code checks that each field has been filled in and will provide an alert if a field has been left blank. In addition, it will also check that email addresses have been entered in the format _@_._
